# Login Demo App

## Overview
This is a small mobile app that makes RESTFUL API requests and simulates a login authentication workflow.


**Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/airtimeEnthusiast/HelloLogin.git
   cd your-rep
   ```

## ðŸš€ How To Run

### 1. Run the Mock API Server

## ðŸ”§ Requirements
	
1.	Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

3.	The server will be running at:

```
http://localhost:3000

### Assumptions
- The iOS App utlized standard MVVM achitecuture where all views that handle data flow contain functions and variables to change the state of the view.
- The API server returns a fake JWT upon a sucessful POST of the credentials from the login screen.
- It is optimized for the API dataset and may need refinement to scale.


### Improvements
- Develop a strategy pattern to the Item and Users list to reduce code redundancy.
